# Algorithm-Programming-Project
This program demonstrates the Selection Problem using the following sorting algorithms: Insertion Sort, HeapSort and Randomized-Select. The program uses an array with 5 indices, each with 20,000 random generated numbers from 0-32767 and runs tests on each index at increaments of 1,000.

The program will output the following graph for the results:
